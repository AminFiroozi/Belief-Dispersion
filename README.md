# Belief Dispersion Sentiment Analysis for Stock News

## Overview
This research project focuses on analyzing belief dispersion in stock market news through sentiment analysis. The project aims to understand how different news sources and market participants interpret and report on stock-related information, potentially revealing market sentiment and belief heterogeneity.

## Research Goals
- Analyze sentiment patterns in stock market news across different sources
- Measure belief dispersion among market participants through news sentiment
- Investigate the relationship between sentiment dispersion and market movements
- Develop quantitative metrics for belief heterogeneity in financial news

## Dataset
This project uses the Financial News Dataset from Hugging Face, which contains over 1.8 million financial news articles. The dataset includes:
- Headlines
- Article URLs
- Publisher information
- Publication dates
- Stock symbols

You can access the dataset here: [Financial News Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ashraq/financial-news)

To use the dataset:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("ashraq/financial-news")
```
